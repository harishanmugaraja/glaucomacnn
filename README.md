The best accuracy achieved with either network was just a bit under 75%. Refer to V2 for a custom architecture that proved to be easier to train than DenseNet121. A segmentation to classification pipleline approach was initially considered, but was not implemented due to time contstraints. While the networks might seem like they were trained in merely 5 epochs, this is simply a result of running the cell repeatedly after it automatically terminates due to the callback placed on it.

Thanks!
